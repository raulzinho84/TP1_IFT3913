### What is this repository for? ###

* This program simply works on GITHUB projects and parses all their files recursiverly and then looks after every Class and every Methode to extract their page link, their names, all associated parameters which is the parsing part in this code. On the other side, after extracting the Class/Method the program looks forward to count the frequency of comments according to the total lines of code assigned to this object. It extractes some values from each object like : 
  - NLOC(Non Commented Lines of Code).
  - CLOC(Commented Lines of Code).
  - LOC(Lines Of Code).
  - DC(Density Of Comments).
  - CC(Class Complexity).
  - WMC(Weighted Methods per Class).
Which will be calculated for both(Classes and Methods).
